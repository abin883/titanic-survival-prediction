# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## 📊 Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering** 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** for better accuracy

## 🔥 Best Model Accuracy:
- **Random Forest (Tuned)**: 81%

## 📂 Files in this Repository:
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` → Full Jupyter Notebook
- `titanic_rf_model.pkl` → Saved model
- `titanic_cleaned.csv` → Processed dataset

## 🚀 How to Use:
1. Download `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`.
2. Run it in **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Load `titanic_rf_model.pkl` to make predictions.
